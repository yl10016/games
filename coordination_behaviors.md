# Coordination behaviors

Coordination problems are a subtopic in the psychology of cooperation. In particular, while cooperation include altruistic behavior (a cooperator confers a benefit on a partner at a cost to himself), coordination is mutualistic: each cooperator confers a benefit on the other while simultaneously conferring a benefit on themself. Then the problem results from the difficulty of converging on a single solution when more than one is available (Thomas et al., 2014).


## Mechanisms for coordination
Types of coordination behaviors, as taken from Okhuysen & Bechky (2009)
1. Plans and rules
    - Formal plans and rules provide a shared understanding of how to coordinate actions
    - Rules guide choices between alternatives when conflicts appear
    - Examples:
        - Defining responsibility for tasks
            - Explaining the actions that different parties have to take to complete a task
        - Resource allocation (e.g. schedules)
            - Plans and rules can ameliorate problems that stem from interdependence and be used to match scarce resources to the tasks that require completion (i.e., use schedules)
2. Objects and representations
    - Physical objects and representations can help coordinate actions by providing a shared reference point
    - Examples:
        - Direct information sharing (via speadsheets, dashboards)
        - Scaffolding (providing structures for action)
        - Creating a common perspective (e.g. patient protocol)
3. Roles
    - Represent expectations associated with social positions, and therefore facilitate continuity of behavior over time
    - Roles can be loosely and dynamically structured, as expectations are negotiated in interaction
    - Examples:
        - Monitoring and updating
        - Substitution
4. Routines
    - Defined as "repeated patterns of behaviour that are bound by rules and customs"
    - Examples
        - Task completion/stability (making completion of a task visible)
        - Enact a way for interdependent parties to observe progress on the task and split task into subtasks
5. Proximity (physical)
6. Monitoring
    - Formally established monitoring practices as well as informal, lateral noticing of others' behavior
7. Updating
    - Communicating the status of the work
8. Anticipating and responding
9. Store of knowledge
    - Individuals learn what others know and can use the group as a store of information to perform the task
10. Developing trust


## Game setup
1. Contextual bandits
    - Goal is to make a sequence of decisions to maximize a reward
    - Each decision is informed by a context (set of features describing the current situation)
    - Model essentially learns to map specific contexts to the best action
    - Example: recommendation systems (based on users' past behavior)
2. Temporally extended
    - Agents are allowed to communicate over multiple rounds, then decide on a final strategy
